## Overview
This project develops and simulates a **Single Particle Model (SPM)** and an **enhanced SPM (eSPM)** for Li-ion batteries using MATLAB (PDEPE). The objective is to accurately model lithium diffusion, electrolyte transport, kinetics, and terminal voltage behavior.

The models are validated against realistic **voltage–capacity (V–Q) curves** and are used to compare performance differences between SPM and eSPM.

## Key Features
- Implemented **SPM/eSPM electrochemical models**  
- Modeled **solid-phase lithium diffusion**, electrolyte polarization, and ohmic losses  
- Included **OCV relationships** and **Butler–Volmer kinetics**  
- Used MATLAB **PDEPE** for solving diffusion PDEs  
- Generated discharge and charge **V–Q curves**  
- Compared SPM vs. eSPM effects on voltage drop, polarization, and reaction kinetics  

## Tools Used
- **MATLAB / PDEPE** for PDE solving  
- Parameter estimation & model validation  
- Visualization of cell voltage and concentration profiles  

## Outputs
- Lithium concentration profiles in active particles  
- Predicted voltage–capacity curves  
- Comparison of SPM vs. eSPM performance  
- Plots showing impact of diffusion and electrolyte resistance  

## Applications
- Li-ion battery modeling  
- Electric-vehicle battery analysis  
- Electrochemical system design  
- Research and teaching in battery science
